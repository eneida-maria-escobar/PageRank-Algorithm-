# PageRank Algorithm Simulation with Adjacency Lists

This project implements a PageRank algorithm using an adjacency list to represent a directed graph of pages and their links. Nodes in the graph correspond to pages, and directed edges represent connections between them. The algorithm calculates PageRank scores iteratively over a specified number of iterations, using a damping factor to account for the likelihood of random jumps between pages. Special cases are handled to ensure accurate rank distribution, particularly for dangling nodes or isolated pages. Finally, the calculated PageRanks are printed in a sorted, formatted manner to showcase the relative importance of each node.
